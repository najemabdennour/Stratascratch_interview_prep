--Find whether the number of drivers that have churned increased or decreased in each year compared to the previous one. 
--Output the year (specifically, you can use the year the driver left Lyft) along with the corresponding number of churns in that year, 
--the number of churns in the previous year, and an indication on whether the number has been increased (output the value 'increase') or 
--decreased (output the value 'decrease'). Order records by the year in ascending order.le number.
