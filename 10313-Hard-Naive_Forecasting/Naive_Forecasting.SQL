--Some forecasting methods are extremely simple and surprisingly effective. Naïve forecast is one of them; 
--we simply set all forecasts to be the value of the last observation. Our goal is to develop a naïve forecast for a new metric 
--called "distance per dollar" defined as the (distance_to_travel/monetary_cost) in our dataset and measure its accuracy.

--To develop this forecast,  sum "distance to travel"  and "monetary cost" values at a monthly level before calculating "distance per dollar". 
--This value becomes your actual value for the current month. The next step is to populate the forecasted value for each month. 
--This can be achieved simply by getting the previous month's value in a separate column. Now, we have actual and forecasted values. 
--This is your naïve forecast. Let’s evaluate our model by calculating an error matrix called root mean squared error (RMSE). 
--RMSE is defined as sqrt(mean(square(actual - forecast)). Report out the RMSE rounded to the 2nd decimal spot.
