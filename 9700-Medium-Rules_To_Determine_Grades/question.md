# Rules To Determine Grades
Find the rules used to determine each grade. Show the rule in a separate column in the format of 'Score > X AND Score <= Y => Grade = A' where X and Y are the lower and upper bounds for a grade. Output the corresponding grade and its highest and lowest scores along with the rule. Order the result based on the grade in ascending order.
